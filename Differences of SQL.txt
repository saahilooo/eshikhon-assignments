Difference between Right Join vs Left Join:

MySQL has mainly two kinds of joins named LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN.
The main difference between these joins is the inclusion of non-matched rows.
The LEFT JOIN includes all records from the left side and matched rows from the right table,
whereas RIGHT JOIN returns all rows from the right side and unmatched rows from the left table.

Difference between Inner Join vs Outer Join:

The biggest difference between an INNER JOIN and an OUTER JOIN is that the inner join will keep only 
the information from both tables that's related to each other
(in the resulting table). An Outer Join, on the other hand,
will also keep information that is not related to the other table in the resulting table.
